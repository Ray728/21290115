            <h2 class="icerikbaslik"><b>• Mock-up Prototype</b></h1>
          <p class="icerikyazi">
            Mock-up prototypes are typically used in the early stages of product development to gather feedback, test design concepts, and identify any potential issues or improvements. These prototypes can be created using various materials and techniques, depending on the type and complexity of the product. The primary purpose of a mock-up prototype is to provide a tangible and realistic representation of the product before investing significant resources in development. It allows designers and stakeholders to visualize the product's aesthetics, dimensions, and overall user experience.

          <p class="icerikyazi">
            Experience your product in a virtual environment, allowing users to truly interact and provide valuable insights into a world of captivating experiences with interactive digital prototypes. These cutting-edge virtual environments provide an unparalleled opportunity to showcase your product and engage users in a dynamic way.
            Gone are the days of static presentations and one-way communication. With interactive digital prototypes, users can actively engage with your product, exploring its features, functionalities, and interfaces. By immersing themselves in this virtual environment, users can gain a firsthand experience of what your product has to offer.

            <h2 class="icerikbaslik"><b>• Functional Prototypes</b></h1>
          <p class="icerikyazi">
            Functional prototypes are essential in the product development process as they allow designers, engineers, and stakeholders to evaluate the feasibility and performance of a product concept. These prototypes are typically built using basic materials and components to showcase the primary features and functionalities, rather than focusing on aesthetics or production-grade quality. The main purpose of a functional prototype is to verify that the key functions of the product work as intended. It helps identify design flaws, technical challenges, and potential improvements early in the development cycle. By creating a tangible model that replicates the expected functionality, designers can assess the user experience, ergonomics, and usability of the product.

                <b>1. Idea Generation: </b>Unleash your creativity and let your imagination flow as you brainstorm a wide range of potential solutions to effectively address the diverse needs and various pain points of your target users. Explore different avenues, think outside the box, and generate a multitude of innovative ideas.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>2. Concept Development:</b> Take those initial ideas and dive deeper into their potential by refining and expanding upon them. Conduct thorough research to gather valuable insights about your users, their preferences, and their unique challenges. Utilize these insights to shape your concepts into well-grounded and comprehensive solutions that are user-centered and cater to their specific requirements.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>3. Prototyping:</b> Bring your refined concepts to life through a series of iterative prototyping. Create tangible representations of your ideas, allowing you to visualize their design and functionality more tangibly. Iterate and refine your prototypes continuously, making adjustments and enhancements to optimize their performance and overall user experience. This iterative process ensures that your final product is carefully honed and perfected to meet the highest standards of quality and usability.            </p>
